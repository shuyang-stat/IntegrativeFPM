Title: Integrative Analysis of Finite Population Mean Combining Probability and Nonprobability Samples
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Shu Yang
Maintainer: Shu Yang <syang24@ncsu.edu>
Description: Implements integrative analyses for the finite population mean parameters combining a non-probability sample with a probability sample which provides high-dimensional representative covariate information of the target population.
    The non-probability sample contains observations on (X,Y); however, the sampling mechanism is unknown. On the other hand, although the probability sample with sampling weights represents the finite population, it contains observations only on X.
    The function "IntegrativeFPM" implements a two-step approach for variable selection and doubly robust finite population inference.
